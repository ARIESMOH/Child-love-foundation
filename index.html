                our goal is to ensure that the children in our communities have at least one warm meal each
                        day. Hunger and malnutrition are devastating for children. Child Love Foundation works in the
                        hardest-to-reach places to address the root causes of hunger to ensure the most vulnerable grow
                        up heathy and nourished.

            <P class="text">
                Child hunger doesn’t actually refer to a grumbling belly caused by a missed meal. Rather, it
                relates to a child experiencing food insecurity — going without food consistently and becoming
                undernourished or malnourished. In the context of global poverty, chronic undernourishment is
                synonymous with hunger.A child is undernourished or malnourished when his or her intake of vitamins and minerals is
                less than what it needs to be for healthy growth and development.

            <P class="text">
                Child hunger is a systemic issue affecting tens of millions of children throughout the world,
                but disproportionately harming children in low- and middle-income countries.Child hunger also contributes to a generational cycle of poverty.
                Hungry children have difficulty focusing in the classroom or learning life skills, which makes it harder for them to
                get a job and provide for a family as an adult. This, in turn, can lead to more child poverty
                and more hungry kids facing the same situation in the future.

                Every day, 9-year old Mary* takes care of her younger 
                siblings instead of going to school since both parents 
                have to look for ways of acquiring food.If food is not available then Mary* and her siblings will have to stay 
                without a meal all day this might be their norm for several days if they are lucky and sometimes they may stay weeks with no meal.
